        <h2 style="text-align: center">How to build a good Overworld Wither Defence (Layered) by Rzghuul</h2>
        <p>To build an atleast decent wither defence you should follow these rules</p>
        <h4>Rule 1</h4>
        <p>No symmetry in terms of groups of 3 Blocks. (more info coming soon or in <a href="https://discord.gg/djRAv33vtm">rzghuul's discord<a>)</p>
        <h4>Rule 2</h4>
        <p>The the centere blocks of the witherbore should be forced to hit lava.</p>
        <h4>Rule 3</h4>
        <p>There should atleast an equal amount of lavasorces and watersorces. Better would be more lavasources.</p>
        <h4>Rule 4</h4>
        <p>No 1x1 Lava sources</p>
        <h4>Rule 5</h4>
        <p>If you have Flowing water have extra protection against fast bores</p>
        <h4>Rule 6</h4>
        <p>Have lava sources that don't have any water diagonal to them (this only works if water does not touch the floor).</p>
        <h4>Rule 7</h4>
        <p>have at least one lava scorce in the path of the witherbore that does not have water infront of it.</p>
        <h4>Rule 8</h4>
        <p>Test your wither defences!</p>
